# SCANDMAN
The Scanned Documents Manager.

Problem Situation: I have lots and lots of scanned documents but after scanning they get lost because I can't index them and I cannot give them descriptions. This new project hopes to solve that.

Requirements.

1. This utility should allow me to index all my scanned documents and give them long descriptions like "Minutes of Board Meeting on 25 July 2016".

2. Thumbnails would be good.

3. Oh, and I can backup my files with one click, or two clicks, or three clicks, ... you get the idea.

4. I don't want to worry about where the scanned images are stored. Or do I? I have to think this one through.

5. It should also brew kapeng barako for me while I'm waiting.
